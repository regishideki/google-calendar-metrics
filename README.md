# How to use it:

- Enable Google Calendar API following the example here:
https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/ruby
- Run it with `ruby main.rb`
- In the first running, the application will ask you to enter in a webpage to retrive a token. This token will be stored in a `token.yml` file. If you wanted to run the application again with another user, you need to delete this file.
